      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        The relationship between human and robot has been one of the most
        important topics since the industrial revolution in the 18th century.
        Western fantasies like to anthropomorphize robots out of the fascination
        and fear of being replaced. We've all have seen movies, TV shows, or
        click-bait articles positioning human as "us" and robots as "them"
        &mdash; will they steal our jobs? Will they guard our home and provide
        emotional and care labor to our children and the elderly? Will they
        realized their oppressed position one day and take revenge? Will they
        live on when we are gone?
        <br /><br />

        In reality, as AI and machine learning are being rapidly developed to
        make robots "smarter", we need to be asking better questions not just on
        the power relations between human to robots, but also human to human.
        Does Alexa really cares whether someone says thank you to them? If
        robots are taking your job away, who is designing those robots and who
        should really be held accountable for your lost job? Can we imagine new
        relationships between human and robots that goes beyond the fantasies of
        the dominant - surbordinate?

        <br /><br />

        For Project #5 you will imagine a new human-robot relationship by
        designing an artificial companion. This is the final project for Code 2,
        which means you now have the option to draw from your ability to
        generate dialogue, use the camera and include facial recognition, add a
        DOM interface, and process images in surprising ways. For the remainig
        of the semester we will cover p5.speech, the Teachable Machine, and a
        few additional libraries listed under
        <i>Resources</i>. In essence you're creating a communication software
        that may or may not have an anthropomorphic appearance. Returning to the
        conversation we had in our very first class on <i>input</i> and
        <i>output</i>, the kinds of cues and expressions you end up designing
        will have a great impact on the meaning of your relationship.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">p5.speech</a> is a p5
        library initiated by Luke DuBois. It enables you to add text-to-speech
        and speech-to-text features into your software, which could come in
        handy for building an artificial companion! Unlike previous libraries
        we've worked with, p5.speech isn't hosted on a CDN. This means you need
        to
        <a
          href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IDMNYU/p5.js-speech/master/lib/p5.speech.js"
          >manually download</a
        >
        the p5.speech.js file, upload it to your sketch folder, and add a link
        to the file inside your index.html &lt;head&gt; tag.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Speech Synthesis
      </h3>
      <p>
        Speech synthesis is a text-to-speech feature that translates a string
        into spoken words. You have a list of different voices to choose from,
        and some of them sound a lot more robotic than the others.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/Ba5OLrIXt"></iframe>
        <!--         <p>&#8627; the speech synthesis wasn't working on chrome for me as of May 4 :( Though it's still working on firefox</p> -->
      </div>
      <p>
        In order to initiate the speech synthesis in your sketch, you would need
        to create a new p5.Speech object at the start of your sketch. And from
        there you could load a series of methods, such as
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">speak()</a> &mdash;
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/756f81aaeb4c1ab0a1bbb5c41003dfa0.js"></script>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/Ba5OLrIXt"
          >Source Code</a
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        Next, you could use
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">listVoices()</a> to
        check out a list of possible voices you could use in your browser, and
        use <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">setVoice()</a> to
        select a voice.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Speech Recognition
      </h3>

      <p>
        Opposite from speech synthesis, speech recognition is a speech-to-text
        feature that translates your spoken words into strings. In order to
        initiate the speech recognition in your sketch, you have to create a new
        p5.SpeechRec object at the start of your sketch, and use
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">start()</a> to begin
        speech recognition, and
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">resultString</a> to
        fetch the most recent detected speech &mdash;
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/32950cf14e74531e52d5da23f7e44cd5.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now there are two settings you could add to your speech recognition
        device. One is called
        <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">continuous</a>, which
        sets up a continuous stream between the browser and Google's cloud
        service. Setting this to true can cause some serious privacy concerns,
        nevertheless it could also increase stability of your software. I guess
        in this case you can't have your cake and eat it too. Another feature to pay attention to is <a href="https://idmnyu.github.io/p5.js-speech/">intrimResults</a>, which decides whether the speech rec would print out a partial, incomplete reading of the speech &mdash;
      </p>
      
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/8d8cbcc7b8eae68fca591ce7494020aa.js"></script>
      
      <p>
        Now that you have the foundation for speech recognition set up, we can dive into using the resultString to trigger some actions!
      </p>
      
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ed1584509d72a29b2f8df34f719b9327.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/BBRBr1p87">Source Code</a>

      <div id="lowercase"><h2>JavaScript toLowerCase()</h2></div>

      <p>
        Sometimes p5.speech voice recogintion would interprets something you've
        said with a capitalized first letter. For instance, the speech recognition example above prints the word
        "circle" as "Circle". And since JavaScript is a case-sensitive language,
        this could cause some of your IF statements to fail. Luckily you could
        use
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tolowercase.asp"
          >toLowerCase()</a
        >, a JavaScript method that turns your string into all lowercase &mdash;
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/kie0u6wTy"></iframe>
      </div>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/57633d0c61fac65b549997cf0441fa57.js"></script>
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can imagine, if there's a toLowerCase() there might also be a
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_touppercase.asp"
          >toUpperCase()</a
        >. This method isn't immediately useful for this project, just something
        to keep in mind if you ever need it in the future.
      </p>

      <div id="find"><h2>JavaScript find()</h2></div>
      <p>
        Next, let's move onto a more complex step and integrate a keyword
        searching feature for your artificial companion. For instance, instead
        of only saying "circle", I could say "could you draw a circle for me
        please" and still have my companion recognize the keyword "circle" and
        understands that it should be drawing an ellipse on the screen. There
        are many different ways to do a keyword search in JavaScript, in this
        example we are going to focus on using
        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-array-find-method/"
          >find()</a
        >, a method that searches for a matching element inside the array.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the first step we need to take here is to split a string into
        an array of individual words. To do this we could use the JavaScript
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp">split()</a>
        &mdash;
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/43d317b7b1ee6642546478e15186934b.js"></script>
      <p>
        Our next step is to use find() to search for the keyword "circle" inside
        of the <i>words</i> array. Let's first create a local variable
        <i>result</i>, which would store the outcome of the search, followed by
        the ideocyncratic syntax of the find() method &mdash;
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/a900d014c00481eab56cf9157a805686.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/UMn7VipLd"
        >Source Code</a
      >
      <p>
        What is happening here is that there is an argument function built
        inside of find(), and it's called to check every single element of the
        array until it finds a matching keyword. You can think of this argument
        function working like a boomrang &mdash; it gets thrown out towards the
        first element of the array, returns when it finds nothing, and gets
        thrown out again to look for the next element of the array. The search
        ends when it returns a value that matches the keyword. This means even
        if you've said "circle" twice inside a sentence, find() would only find
        the first one and the search would end.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">

      />
      </div>
      <p>
        Besides find(), there are other ways to search and sort words inside an array in JavaScript. Here is a summary borrowed from Mozilla's MDN web docs &mdash;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">If you need the index of the found element in the array, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex">findIndex()</a></li>
        <li class="bullet">If you need to find the index of a value, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf">Array.prototype.indexOf()</a> (It’s similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex">findIndex()</a>, but checks each element for equality with the value instead of using a testing function)</li>
        <li class="bullet">If you need to find if a value exists in an array, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes">Array.prototype.includes()</a></li>
        <li class="bullet">If you need to find if any element satisfies the provided testing function, use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some">Array.prototype.some()</a></li>
        
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you can see, the journey of JavaScript is fruitful and filled with adventures. Proceed safely and have fun!

      <div id ="switch">
        <h2>
          switch Statement Pt.2
        </h2>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        One of the common issue in bot creation is that you have to teach the bot to understand that there are many ways to say the same thing. For instance, to greet someone I could say "hi", "hello", "hey", "howdy", and ideally the bot should understand those different words as having the same meaning and respond accordingly. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is where switch statement can come into play! When we omit "break" inside the switch statement, it would basically work like a waterfall, so the detected string would get compared to multiple different cases until it finds a match &mdash;
      </p>
      
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/b7e2877dfb2e0eee9aaf2ac30bb5a91f.js"></script>
      
      <p>
        Adding an additional feature here so that the bot would also be able to tell the time ^_^
